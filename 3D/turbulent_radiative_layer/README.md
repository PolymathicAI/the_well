# Turbulent Radiative Mixing Layers

**One line description of the data:** In many astrophysical systems, hot gas moves relative to cold gas, which leads to mixing. Mixing populates intermediate temperature gas that is highly reactive — in this case it is rapidly cooling.

**Longer description of the data:** In this simulation, there is cold, dense gas on the bottom and hot dilute gas on the top. They are moving relative to each other at highly subsonic velocities. This set up is unstable to the Kelvin Helmholtz instability, which is seeded with small scale noise that is varied between the simulations. The hot gas and cold gas are both in thermal equilibrium in the sense that the heating and cooling are exactly balanced. However, once mixing occurs as a result of the turbulence induced by the Kelvin Helmholtz instability, the intermediate temperatures become populated. This intermediate temperature gas is not in thermal equilibrium, and cooling beats heating. This leads to a net mass flux from the hot phase to the cold phase. This process occurs in the interstellar medium, and in the Circum-Galactic medium when cold clouds move through the ambient, hot medium. By understanding how the total cooling and mass transfer scale with the cooling rate, we are able to constrain how this process controls the overall phase structure, energetics and dynamics of the gas in and around galaxies.
