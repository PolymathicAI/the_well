# Euler equations - Riemann problems

**One line description of the data:**  Evolution starting with piecewise constant initial data in quadrants.

**Longer description of the data:**  The evolution can give rise to shocks, rarefaction waves, contact discontinuities, interaction witheach other and domain walls
